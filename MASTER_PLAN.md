### Squash bugs
- Chain can be activated outside of the mount radius
- Culling is over-eager for cuboids in the direct corners of the screen
- Seeker enemies will slam into the wall bc the speed cap uses absolute value
### Level design
- Research/figure out a sustainable loop for level design
### Playtesting
- Collect feedback from playtesters
- Refine feedback into actionable items
## Writing
- Why does the Spirit know about the erasure from history?
- What's the story behind the player character?
- Basic outline for each cyst layer expedition
## Art
## Sound
### Music 
### SFX
