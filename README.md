## Basic Instructions



### Default Controls

I have only tested this on Windows with a Switch Pro Controller (because I don't have any other controllers lol). Theoretically the library I used for gamepad input should work for most any controller, but I had a bunch of issues just getting the pro controller to work - it had to be connected with bluetooth rather than USB-C, for example. Hopefully it's not as bad for other controllers but idk
